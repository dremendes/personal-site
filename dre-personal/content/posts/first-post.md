## Ok I will start blogging

I got laid off last December.

The whole team, actually. I thought it would be easier to get a new job.

I was wrong. The market right now if full of excellent engineers looking for a new role.

I am competent but far from competent as the most competent engineer I worked with.

This engineer got laid off the same time I did. He's still looking for a job. This terrifies me.

Companies with open roles are overwhelmed with applications, they are taking longer to answer than ever before.

Even companies without financial insecurities are laying people off. They are using this seasonal situation to rub down on costs. It would look bad to do it in another situation.

I've done a few technical assessments. 3, so far. 
Got one rejection and I agreed with their evaluation. I should had taken the requirements more seriously. 

I am still waiting for evaluations for other 2 tests.

### I think it is important to differentiate oneself from the crowd. So I am blogging again
