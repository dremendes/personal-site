## Spacex Challenge

This is a Full-stack challenge I wrote for a company. I am still waiting for a response from them.

In sumary, they asked to use SpaceXâ€™s graphQL API to exhibit SpaceX data.

I built it with Next.js and I am not a Full-stack developer. Next.js is cool.

I thought the resulted looked fine so I'm sharing: [https://spacex-launches-nine.vercel.app/](https://spacex-launches-nine.vercel.app/)
