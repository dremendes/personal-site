      <description>Ok I will start blogging I got laid off last December.
The whole team, actually. I thought it would be easier to get a new job.
I was wrong. The market right now if full of excellent engineers looking for a new role.
I am competent but far from competent as the most competent engineer I worked with.
This engineer got laid off the same time I did. He&amp;rsquo;s still looking for a job.</description>
