<p>I got laid off last December.</p>
<p>The whole team, actually. I thought it would be easier to get a new job.</p>
<p>I was wrong. The market right now if full of excellent engineers looking for a new role.</p>
<p>I am competent but far from competent as the most competent engineer I worked with.</p>
<p>This engineer got laid off the same time I did. He&rsquo;s still looking for a job. This terrifies me.</p>
<p>Companies with open roles are overwhelmed with applications, they are taking longer to answer than ever before.</p>
<p>Even companies without financial insecurities are laying people off. They are using this seasonal situation to rub down on costs. It would look bad to do it in another situation.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve done a few technical assessments. 3, so far.
Got one rejection and I agreed with their evaluation. I should had taken the requirements more seriously.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for evaluations for other 2 tests.</p>
